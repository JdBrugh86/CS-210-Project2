# CS-210-CPP

This program takes in client input and outputs deposit info in two charts, one with and one without client monthly deposits.
I feel my code was written quite well but I feel should have moved all of my functions to public, except for the closing amount and interest accrual funcitons, so 
my class can be reused in other programs. I could have compressed my two interest accrual functions into one overloaded function by setting t_depositMonthly default to 0
and calling it appropriately in my code. I struggled to visualize the spacing of the output charts as I was writing the code so a lot of trial and error occured. I could 
"see" it in my minds eye when tired but the next morning the vision was lost. I looked at examples from our readings and others' example code on stackoverflow. After 
writing the border/spacing function, the knowledge gained in "seeing" the spacing as I write the code will be invaluable. If I transfer the functions mentioned earlier 
in my writing, I believe my code can be reused in other banking type programs. As for maintainability, my code is written very clearly with notes as to what the functions
do and allow for easy use or modification in the future.
